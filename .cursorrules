3. **ServiceM8 integration foundation** - API client setup before webhook system
4. **Data sync order** - Initial import before realtime updates
5. **Testing phases** - Unit tests throughout, integration/E2E after core features
6. **Environment setup** - All configs and keys established before dependent features

---

## Technical Dependencies Map
```
Phase 1 (Foundation) → Phase 2 (Database) → Phase 3 (Auth)
                                        ↓
Phase 4 (ServiceM8) → Phase 5 (Webhooks) → Phase 6 (Admin Portal)
                                        ↓
Phase 7 (Client Portal) → Phase 8 (Feedback) → Phase 9 (UX)
                                             ↓
Phase 10 (Push) → Phase 11 (Reconciliation) → Phase 12 (Testing) → Phase 13 (Deployment)
```
